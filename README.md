What is Queuify?

Queuify is a game changing iOS app designed to streamline your wait at popular destinations. 
With Queuify, you can join digital queues and enjoy other activities while your spot is hold. 
Users can join a queue as an individuel or as a group by selecting the number of people accompanying 
you. Queue smarter with Queuify. 


What inspired Queuify?

I was inspired by Queuify after a 4 hour queue to get access to the Vatican city. Leaving the city,
I promised myself to find a solution to better use our time (plus, i felt bad for my mom who was in 
line the entire time while the rest of the family went off) and so Queuify was born. 


What was Queuify's journey?

This was the first app I ever designed so the beginning was tough. I watched countless youtube videos to help me 
learn the basics of the swift programming language. I also went through several design iterations for the user 
interface before finally settling down with one that satasfied my vision. As I don't have a macbook, I started 
off using the Swift playgrounds app on my ipad. However, this was only tempermental and I had to later switch 
to xcode via my school mac computers. This was a very difficult transistion as I had never used Xcode before and so I
recieved a lot of xcode related errors setting up which took hours to solve! As I was slow to progress with Xcode, I 
continued to develop my app during the summer. But this meant that I could only work using Xcode when the school door's 
were open, aka Sunday mornings. This setup was at first very frustrating for me because I had limited time (2 hours a week); 
later on, I learned to go away with lots of ideas and time to research. I wouldn't say that my journey working on Queuify has 
been smooth, but it has furfilled me and given me hope, perservance and resiliance along the way. 


How to use Queuify

I believe that Queuify will only ever truly be successful, if anyone of any age can use and access it without confusion. 

Joining a queue: 
1) To join a queue, press the 'join queue' button on the welcome page 
2) Search for the name of the destination you wish to queue for (in my testflight one general example is museum)
3) Select your destination. If it doesn't exist, a message will appear telling you so.
4) Select how many people are joining the queue. Is it only you? If so, choose individuel otherwise enter the exact number.
5) If you are sure you want to join the queue at the moment, press the 'join queue' and 'I agree' button. At this page, you can see the
   current number of people already waiting.
6)You are now offically in the queue and can track your position!
7) When you feel like you are getting close to the end, pop over to the actual place.
8) To offically leave the queue, press the 'leave queue' button.
9) Optional: leave a review and comment.

Starting a queue:
This step is mainly for organizations and companies who want to publish their own digital queues on Queuify for their customers. 
However, I have created an automated invoice process that is triggered when this step is complete so I wouldn't advise actually 
testing this step as you will get automatic invoices. 

1) To start a queue, press the 'start queue' button on the welcome page.
2) Fill in the required details and make sure to read the terms&conditions
3) Press 'done' to push your new destination in the system.
4) If there is an already-existing destination with the same name, you will have to repeat the process again.
   Otherwise, a popup will appear saying 'congratulations!'. 


What is Queuify's vision?

I hope to publish Queuify first in the United Kingdom before expanding internationally so all travellers, 
friends and families can experience a more enjoyable time with less waiting in the line. The user will pay just £1, 
per person, regardless of how long they wait in line. The service fee is collected by the destination’s organization 
upon entry and then forwarded. This will hopefully help gather funds to allow Queuify to re-invest and grow.
